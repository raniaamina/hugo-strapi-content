**Inkporter** is a powerful tool to help your productivity with Inkscape. This tool is available as a Command Line Interface and Inkscape Extension, so you can choose the best option for you.

## How It Works
Inkporter reads ID patterns (i.e icon-1, icon-2, icon-3, etc) that you've set and then exports them to the file format that you need. Inkporter allows you to feel like you are working with artboards or multiple pages in Inkscape.

## Inkporter Features
Artboard-like export
Multiple PDF Page Export (Booklet)
JPG and PDF with CMYK export
And various export formats for productivity (PNG, JPG, SVG, EPS, PDF, and WEBP)

For detail documentation please refer to [Inkporter Wiki](https://inkporter.raniaamina.id)
